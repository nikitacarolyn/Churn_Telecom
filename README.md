## Churn Telecom dataset:

In data analysis, churn refers to the phenomenon of customers or users discontinuing their relationship with a company or ceasing their engagement with a product or service. 
It is commonly used in industries such as telecommunications, software, subscription-based services, and e-commerce.

## Churn analysis 
It focuses on understanding and predicting customer attrition rates, identifying factors that contribute to churn, and developing strategies to mitigate it. By analysing historical data and patterns, companies can gain insights into why customers are leaving and take proactive measures to retain them.

**Churn can be classified into two types:** 

1. Customer Churn: This refers to the loss of customers or users. Customer churn analysis aims to understand the reasons behind customer attrition and develop retention strategies. It typically involves analyzing customer behavior, demographics, purchase history, customer support interactions, and other relevant data.

2. Revenue Churn: This refers to the loss of revenue generated from existing customers. Revenue churn analysis focuses on understanding the monetary impact of customer attrition. It involves analyzing changes in recurring revenue, average revenue per user, and other financial metrics.

This project aims to clean, analyse, visualise the churn data in order to model the data, here using Logistic regression as a base model and Random Forest and Support Vector Machine (SVM). In conclusion, from the precision, recall and F1 score, the SVM model appears to be better in predicting the customer attrition rate in this case.
